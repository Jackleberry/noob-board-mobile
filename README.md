#Noob Board for Mobile

I used the react-native command line tools to generate this project. [See how to do it here](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#content).

To start the app

`npm install`

`npm start`

I like to explicity do an npm start here so that it starts in the window I want it to, but you don't have to. When running the command below, npm start will be run as well. It starts running on port 8081 by default so make sure that's not in use.

This does a whole lot of stuff and starts up your emulator. You can change the simulator or device it uses.

`react-native run-ios`
