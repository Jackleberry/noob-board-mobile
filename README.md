#Noob Board for Mobile

I used the react-native command line tools to generate this project. [https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#content](See here how to do it).

To start the app

`cd NoobBoard`

I like to do this so that it starts in the window I want it to, but you don't have to. It starts running on port 8081 by default so make sure that's not in use.

`npm start`

This does a whole lot of stuff and starts up your emulator. You can change the simulator or device it uses.

`react-native run-ios`
